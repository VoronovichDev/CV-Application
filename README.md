# CV Application

This is React-application for constructing CVs (cv-creactor). 
I first wrote this app on class components. Then (after learning hooks) revisited and rewrote on hooks

The goal is to create a CV constructor that collects data from inputs and outputs it to an html-block that we can edit if needed
